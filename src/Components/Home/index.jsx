                    Star Wars is an American epic space-opera multimedia
                    franchise created by George Lucas, which began with the
                    eponymous 1977 film and quickly became a worldwide
                    pop-culture phenomenon. The franchise has been expanded into
                    various films and other media, including television series,
                    video games, novels, comic books, theme park attractions,
                    and themed areas, comprising an all-encompassing fictional
                    universe. In 2020, its total value was estimated at US$70
                    billion, and it is currently the fifth-highest-grossing
                    media franchise of all time.
